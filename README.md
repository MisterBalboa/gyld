# approach

In my opinion this is a supervised clustering problem.
We have data to study the case before creating a classification model to put players into teams. Domain knowledge should be used to interpret what is a balanced team so I will make a few assumptions after exploring the data.

I did use AI for this solution.

# Include a brief README explaining:
# One modeling choice you made and why in 2-4 sentences.
# Key tradeoffs you made due to the time limit
# What you would add if you had more time
# Time spent (one line, hh:mm)
# If you used AI: create a prompts/ folder with 1–3 short prompts and a FIXES.md listing 3–5 concrete corrections you made (reference file + function or a 1–2 line snippet for each). If you didn’t use AI, skip prompts/ and include a DECISIONS.md with 3–5 bullets pointing to where you made key choices (file + function or snippet).
# Indicate whether or not you used AI in your README
